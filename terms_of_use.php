19. Referral Credit Program
<br>
On certain of its Sites, GetMeCV may offer members the ability to earn credits or discounts ('Referral Credits') toward future bookings on the GetMeCV Sites when they invite friends to become members of a GetMeCV Site and those friends make a qualifying booking sent through an authorized GetMeCV invitation channel (e.g. an invitation sent through GetMeCV's website, Facebook or another social media channel supported by GetMeCV). You may only earn Referral Credits via GetMeCVs authorized member invite mechanisms. Referrals outside of GetMeCV authorized channels will not result in any Referral Credit. You understand that Referral Credits are not transferable, may not be auctioned, bartered or sold, may not be pooled with other members. You will only receive Referral Credit for the first qualifying booking made by a friend who makes his or her first booking on the GetMeCV Sites and subsequently completes his or her first booking as a result of an invite from you via a GetMeCV authorized channel. If your friend does not follow the directions in the invite email or other valid invite mechanism to accept the invitation, you may not receive Referral Credit, and GetMeCV will have no liability to you for your friends failure to follow directions.
<br>
You agree that having multiple GetMeCV accounts is a violation of these Terms and Conditions and that sending invites to alternate email addresses or accounts or otherwise attempting to circumvent GetMeCVs referral credit program system may, without limiting any other GetMeCV rights or remedies, result in forfeiture of your membership and all Referral Credits in your account. GetMeCV reserves the right to void referrals and Referral Credits earned if we suspect that the referrals or Referral Credits were earned in a fraudulent manner, in a manner that violates these Terms and Conditions or in a manner otherwise not intended by GetMeCV. You must not conduct your own promotion in connection with our referral credit program. You may not engage in any promotional, marketing, or other advertising activities on behalf of GetMeCV, including by using any trademarks of GetMeCV.
<br>
Referral Credits will appear in your account within 24 hours of one of your qualifying invitees completing his or her qualifying activity booked on GetMeCV's website.
<br>
The referral credit program is void where prohibited by law. GetMeCV reserves the right to modify or terminate the referral credit program at any time. Should there be any tax liability for the accumulation and/or use of Referral Credits, such taxes are the sole responsibility of the participant. You understand that your account may not accurately reflect the Referral Credits you have actually earned. GetMeCV will have no liability for any errors displayed in your account.
